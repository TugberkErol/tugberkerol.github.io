# Power of Certainty

**Abstract:**  
This project introduces a self-distillation method that uses model uncertainty to enhance polyp segmentation. It guides the network to produce more reliable and consistent predictions by leveraging certainty-weighted loss and BN-statistics-based confidence.  

## Key Highlights
- Certainty-weighted loss  
- BN-statistics confidence  
- Test-time filtering  
- Self-distillation aligning mid- and deep-layer representations
