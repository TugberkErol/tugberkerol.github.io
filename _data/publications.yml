  title: "PlutoNet: An Efficient Polyp Segmentation Network with Modified Partial Decoder and Decoder Consistency Training"
  venue: Healthcare Technology Letters 
  description: "PlutoNet is a lightweight polyp segmentation model that uses a novel decoder consistency training with a shared encoder, modified partial decoder, and auxiliary decoder to efficiently capture multi-scale and semantic features, achieving superior performance with far fewer parameters than state-of-the-art models."
